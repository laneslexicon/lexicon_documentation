The contents is prsented as tree with levels: letter,root,head word:

#####Navigation

To move up and down the tree, use the ↑ and the ↓ keys. You can also set two other keys to do the same (by default they are 'w' for up and 's' for down.)

Moving around the tree will not expand or collapse letters or roots. To do this use the <space> key or 'x' (config). These keys toggle the state: they will either expand a collapsed node or collapse and expanded node.
