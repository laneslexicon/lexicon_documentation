### Cross references


Lane indicated cross-references in the text with a down-arrow, as explained in the Preface page xxiv :

*but every word ... explained in a paragraph headed by another word is also mentioned by itself, or accompanied by a word or words nearly resembling it in form, with a reference to that paragraph. (In order to facilitate the reference, an arrow-head (â†“) is inserted to render conspicuous a word explained in a paragraph headed by another word.)*

As in the following example:

![Cross foreign](/images/foreign_orth.png)


In this application,  the cross-references have been converted to clickable links. However, not all links have been resolved by the software: links with an identified target are blue, unresolved links are red.

[There are 36,031 cross-references in the entire lexicon, of which 21,322 have been resolved.]


### Fixing a cross-reference

The user can repair a broken link manually by doing the following:

+ Break content-linking using the icon on the status bar or the shortcut

+ Find the target of the link in the contents panel

+ Left-click and drag the target onto the link and release the mouse button


When dragging the target an icon is displayed alongside the cursor:


![drag icon](/images/fixlinksymbol.png)


On releasing the cursor on the target, a dialog appears:

<a name="fixlinkdialog"></a>
![Fix link dialog](/images/fixlinkdialog.png)


This process can be repeated any number of times.


### Exporting and Importing fixes
<a name="export"></a>

If the user has repaired broken links, these fixes will be removed if the software is re-installed or an updated database is installed.

For this reason, links should be saved to a file using the *Tools -> Export links* menu option prior to any software updates and then reloaded using *Tools -> Import links*.

The author of the software will be happy to receive and make generally available, any fixes. Please see the [Contact](../contact.md) page for details.
