#### Some things that are different


#### Handling of root entries

Lane has a number of entries which take the forms: *xxx yyy zzz* or *xxx and yyy* or *xxx or yyy*, such as the following from Volume 3, page 850:

![Two roots](/images/tworoots.png)


For each of these forms a full entry has been written for the first word in the list but every other entry has a link back to the first. Using the above example:

#### Supplement merge

.supplement { background-color : lightgray }


#### Head entries - multi-word heads
<a name="headword"></a>

Many entries, such as the one below, contain not a single head word but a head phrase. The software attempts to identify a single headword for each entry and, by default, shows this in the contents panel. The *Head search* dialog also targets this single headword by default. This behaviour can changed by setting the relevant option [here](../options/contents.md#headphrase) or [here](../options/entry.md#headphrase).
