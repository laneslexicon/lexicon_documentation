This software provides a presentation of Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, based on the digitization of the original text done by  the [Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Arabic).

As such it is a standalone, self-contained desktop application that does not require an internet connection.

It provides the ability to view and search the Lexicon, allowing individual entries to be viewed, printed or copied and pasted into external applications.
