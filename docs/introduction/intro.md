The purpose of this software is to provide its' users with a means to read Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon in a modern format; the content has not changed, merely its presentation.

In this format the Lexicon can be easily browsed and searched, entries can be printed, copied to the clipboard and their appearance customized , for example, to use an Arabic font of the user's choice.

This software would not have been possible with the digitization of Lane's original text as part of the [Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Arabic). (Note: external links will be opened in your normal browser.)
