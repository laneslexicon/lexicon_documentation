As described [here](../custom/custom.md) the styling information, e.g. font information, is set using CSS stylesheets. However for technical reasons this is not always possible and the styling information has to be applied by other means.

The options presented here will be embedded within the "style" attribute of an HTML fragment and should be edited accordingly.

These settings can also be changed using the Font Dialog (see [here](../custom/font.md)).

All of the options relate only to Arabic text and many of them occur in the context ofo information presented in tabular format.
