#### Image directory

All the images are stored in the given directory which is part of the theme directory structure described [here](../custom/themes.md).


Each entry shows the name of the file and a button showing the appearance of the icon. Clicking on the button will open a file browser dialog that can be used to set the file name.


***Note*** The "Notes" file *must* be in X PixMap (xpm) format. (This is small icon that appears next to a lexicon entry to signify that it has an attached note. See [here](../user-guide/notes.md).)
