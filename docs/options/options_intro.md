A description of how the options are organized can be found in the [customization](../custom/themes.md) section.


The following pages describe some of the options that are available; not every option is explained, it is hoped that those that are not will be self-evident.

+ Paths to files should either be relative to the current working directory or absolute file paths. The current working directory is shown in the System tab of the *About* dialog (*Main menu -> Help -> About*).


+ In the description that follows the term "theme directory" refers to a path made up of the working directory, "themes" and the theme name. For example, if the current theme is called "mytheme", the theme directory is: &lt;working directory&gt;/themes/mytheme.


+ The options are stored in a plain text configuration file and can be edited outside of the application. (The name of file is shown on the System tab of the *About* dialog.)

+ Changing many of these settings will require the application to be restarted.
